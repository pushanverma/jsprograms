üìå What is the diffrence b/w JavaScript and Node.js ?

Most pepople , can solve questions related to javascript , but can't answer this simple question.
Most people end up answering that node.js is javascript , But they are partially wrong.
Let me explain with a analogy,
JavaScript is a programming language and Node.js provides a environment for javascript to run(i.e it has all the things , which is required to execute a js program) , 
just like Office provides environment for employees to work (Node.js provides environment for javascript to run)
