Earlier , we use to have only one variable i.e var , which was "function Scoped", but it was showing 
problems ,
Same var can be accessed anywhere throughout the program , 


So , let and const is created which are "Block Scoped"



Diffrence b/w Function and block Scoped ?

Function Scope , variable whose scope is limited to a function and Block scoped means , whose scope
is limited to a block i.e Block can be -> if block, for loop
