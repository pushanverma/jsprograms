Earlier , we use to have only one variable i.e var , which was "function Scoped", but it was showing 
problems ,
Same var can be accessed anywhere throughout the program , 


So , let and const is created which are "Block Scoped"



Diffrence b/w Function and block Scoped ?

Function Scope , variable whose scope is limited to a function and Block scoped means , whose scope
is limited to a block i.e Block can be -> if block, for loop



üñäÔ∏è Hello module ,this will tell you how functions and variables interact in diffrent situations

 1.before(done)
 2.after(done)
 3.var,let and const inside a function  (declaring variable inside the function, accessing outside)
 4.var,let and const outside a function (declaring variable outside , accessing inside the function)
 5.reassigning changes(changing values)-updating(done)
 6.hoisting
